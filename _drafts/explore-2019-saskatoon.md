Between the end of my third year at McGill and the beginning of my internship at Capital One, I spent four weeks studying French in the great city of Saskatoon. Nicknamed the "Paris of the Prairies", Saskatoon is a quaint city located on the Saskatchewan that in no way resembles Paris. Even so, I found the city to be incredibly welcoming, diverse, and absolutely beautiful.

diversity:
before arriving in the city, my McGill friends had all made fun of me for choosing saskatoon. for them, Saskatoon represented an isolated city in the middle of the country that was boring and white af. in reality, however, the city has an enormous and diverse population that has given it a multinational identity. you can find vietnamese restaurants, italian bakeries, and your standard multinational american businesses peacefully coexisting...

beauty:
saskatoon is brutally cold in the winter, where temperatures can reach -40 C. but in the summer, the days are long, the sky is clear, and the river serves as a perfect backdrop to the rest of the city. also called "bridge city", saskatoon has at least five bridges that cross the Saskatchewan river. These bridges serve as excellent locations to watch the sunset and see the river as it flows... 

but, at the end of the day, it was the people that i met in saskatoon that made saying goodbye so difficult. everyone that I met, be it the residents or other visitors that were there to learn french like myself, presented themselves excellently and ... in particular, I was a really big fan of my French teacher, who engaged us students in meaningful and thoughtful conversations in only French. i planned to go to saskatoon because I figured i'd never have a reason to visit. after having visited, i feel like i only have more reason to go back. To anyone that is considering a trip there, i would highly recommend it.
