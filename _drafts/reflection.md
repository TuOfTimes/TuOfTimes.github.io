This Fall I will be going back to McGill University in Montreal, Canada, to finish up the final year of my undergraduate degree. When all is said and done, I will have been through 5 years of elementary school, 3 years of middle school, 4 years of high school, and 4 years of university. Along the way we've been told to think about our careers many times along the way. In fourth grade we wrote about our dream jobs, and I put "surgeon" on the worksheet because that was my idea of a respectable and meaningful job. Fast forward to high school, we were writing letters to our future selves, and I again wrote about how I hoped I would make a great doctor. But of the many times that I thought I would become a doctor, not once did I think about what that would really mean. Would I be able to work that job for 40 hours a week for the next 30 years? How would I find meaning in it?

Through my first two years of university I continued to believe that I was destined to be a doctor, and I selected my concentration and courseload accordingly. However, the summer after sophomore year, through conversations with doctor friends, I realized that perhaps medicine wasn't the career for me. Perhaps I didn't want to work 100 hour work weeks and memorize textbooks in order to prepare myself for a job that I wasn't sure I'd even enjoy. 

So I pivoted to Computer Science and started pursuing a future in Software Engineering. I was mostly attracted by the high salary that came with relatively minimal schooling. But the field isn't as glamorous as people make it out to be. I really enjoy coding. I enjoy building products. But sometimes the products you build don't matter to you, and sometimes you have to fix shit that other people built. 

...

I am still young. I still have the opportunity to go back to school and retrain myself for my dream career. But what exactly does that mean? If I were to dedicate 40 hours per week to something for the rest of my life, I sure as hell want it to be something meaningful. Maybe it's family that I want to dedicate my life to. Maybe it's a social cause. Or maybe it's creating a product that will modernize some sector of the world. When someone asks you what you do for a living, is there a difference between "I connect people from all walks of life" and "I bring education and wellness to the impoverished children of Southeast Asia"? Which one is better?




opening: 
- introduction and context
- idea: school tells us to think about what we want from a career, but we never think about it in the right way. how do you imagine yourself spending 40 hours a week at a job until you've finally done it? 

why i am thinking about this:
- i am at the brink of 

what i think:
- i am not super happy with my current internship as a career prospect
- i want something meaningful out of life
- i am still young and still have the time to explore, so i should do it while i can
