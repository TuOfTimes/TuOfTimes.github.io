## Introduction

Twitter is a social media platform where users interact through "tweets" - short text entries that are shared to one's timeline. Like many social media platforms, users can follow one another, share each others tweets, and favorite tweets to express agreement. For many, the gaining of followers can be used to extend one's sphere of influence. In this project I created a bot automatically amasses followers.

### Gaining Followers
I elected to take advantage of a trend called `#followforfollow`, where many users who are looking to increase their follower count will follow back anyone who follows them. The bot that I created will search out and follow users who are willing to follow me back. It is worth mentioning that these followers can be considered "low quality" as they are not engaged with the content that I am sharing, but instead following me purely because I follow them.
