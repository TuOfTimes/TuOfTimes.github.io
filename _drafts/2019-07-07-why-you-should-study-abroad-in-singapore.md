It's been over a year since I studied abroad in Singapore. There is a running joke going around that anyone who goes on exchange will never shut up about their exchange. I'm definitely guilty of that, but for good reason. Singapore was an excellent exchange destination for several reasons:

## Excellent Academics

Studying abroad is, first and foremost, about learning. Learning about the culture and language of your host city, and of course taking classes. I studied at the National University of Singapore for a semester, where I listened to passionate professors explain topics from Mendelian genetics, to relational database systems, to the everyday life of the Chinese Singaporean. These classes were stimulating and rigorous, and they prepared me well for my courses back home. For anyone studying in Singapore, I would highly recommend the course "Daily Life of the Chinese Singaporean".

## Fantastic Infrastructure

Due to its history, Singapore has a habit of being brutally pragmatic - everything is done with purpose, and nothing is overlooked. While this may have created an unhealthy amount of competition among its inhabitants, the sentiment has also lead to the creation of an incredibly well-designed city: the public transportation system is excellent and extremely affordable, the streets are pristine, and most neighborhoods are very safe. Recently, bike-sharing has also become popular in Singapore. The dockless bikes are ubiquitous, making them easy to pickup and drop off wherever. Consiering the heat and humidity of the city, these bikes help reduce time outdoors that would otherwise be spent walking.

## Amazing Food

As an melting pot of cultures, the food in Singapore is insurmountable. The local delicacies such as bak kut teh and Hainanese chicken rice are to die for. The selection is vast, and even the pickiest eaters will find something to satisfy their hunger (it might take a bit of trial and error, though).

## Perfect Location

Lastly, Singapore is the perfect base from which to explore the entirety of Southeast Asia. You can find flights to nearby cities for as little as $50USD, with most destination costing no more than $200USD. Singapore's Changi Airport is extremely efficient and clean, and offers amenities such as theatres and sleeping areas for transiting passengers. Being in the top airport in the world at the beginning and end of a trip is...

I was extremely fortunate to be able to spend five months in such a beautiful city. For anyone looking for a destination for exchange (or even just to visit), I would wholeheartedly reccomend Singapore.
