As I finished up my search for summer internships this past semester, I took some time to reflect on the three years it took to get to where I am, and where I thought I'd be in another three years. 

I entered McGill University in 2016 in the biomedical and life sciences stream with hopes of one day becoming a doctor. (but in high school my interests and strengths were always in math and cs). to reconcile my strengths and my dreams, i decided to enroll in the computer science and biology major. 

the summer after my first year, i worked as a research assistant at new england biolabs. it was a beautiful campus and the project i contributed to was very interesting, but the work i was assigned was menial and repepetitive. my pi had been working on his paper for almost three years and he was only just finishing up. after this summer, i decided that i couldn't work in research: a lot of work goes in, but there's too much uncertainty.

i didn't want to do medicine because it is physically taxing and takes up much of your time in your younger years, time that you will never get back. the idea that a job is more meaningful is something that seems to get tossed around, but in the end a job is just a job.

i just got finished applying to software engineering internships for next summer. i probably sent a hundred applications, got no more than 10 responses, 3 final round interviews, and 2 offers. got my ass ghosted by lyft. at this point in my college career i am committed to pursuing a career in tech.

so what would i change? if i could keep all of my experiences and start over, i would've done my degree in math and computer science, and worked much hard on projects in order to land a big internship in the summer of my sophomore year.

but, in the path that i took, i was able to keep my options open and explore career options. i'm glad that i had the chance to experience the careers and decide for myself that medicine wasn't what i wanted. the only thing i would change is to go on exchange third year instead of second year.


- preface
  - who i am and why you should listen to me
- my major
- my activities
- social events
- conclusion: college is a time of discovery and self reflection, and these are the things that I've learned about myself in my time at school. if you're in a similar position, i ask that you take my experiences with a grain of salt. i hope you can find hope or inspiration in them, but the only true way to learn your lesson is to experience it for yourself
