when i picked singapore as my study abroad destination, it was based on personal connection. but after spending four months there, i can say that there are many more reasons to go.

if you're like me (that is to say a giant nerd), singapore boasts one of the best education systems in the world. every class is graded on a bell curve, which means getting good grades can be difficult. but it also means that failing is very difficult, which is nice if you're exchange semester is graded on a pass-fail basis.

Due to its history, Singapore has a habit of being brutally pragmatic - everything is done with a purpose and nothing is overlooked. As a result, the public transportation system is excellent and extremely affordable, and most locations are usually no more than half an hour away. By public transportation, one can explore the countryside, shop at Orchard Road, and people watch in the Downtown area. this also means that everything is super clean and people are extremely nice.

As an melting pot of cultures, the food in Singapore is insurmountable. The local delicacies such as bak kut teh and Hainanese chicken rice are to die for. The selection is vast, and even the pickiest eaters will find something to satisfy their hunger (it might take a bit of trial and error, though).

Lastly, Singapore is the perfect base from which to explore the entirety of Southeast Asia. You can find flights to nearby cities for as little as $50USD, with most destination costing no more than $200USD. Singapore's Changi Airport is extremely efficient and clean, and offers amenities such as theatres and sleeping areas for transiting passengers. Being in the top airport in the world at the beginning and end of a trip is...

While Singapore has a lot to offer exchange students, it isn't perfect. I would offer up two warnings before you go: First, if your idea of a good time is imbibing illicit substances, Singapore is not the place for you. Drug smuggling is a serious offence in Singapore, and punishments range from caning to imprisonment and death by hanging. Alcohol is available, but it is heavily taxed (although ladies can get free drinks from bars and clubs on Wednesdays). Second, the weather is hot and humid all year long, and those who cannot handle high temperatures should be warned. Most dormitory rooms are not air conditioned, but fans are available, and bamboo or woven grass mats work wonders.
