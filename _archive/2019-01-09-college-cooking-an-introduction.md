After my first year at McGill, I moved out of the residential halls to an apartment off campus. This meant that I'd have access to my own kitchen, and that I was no longer obligated to purchase the mandatory (and overpriced) student meal plan. For students with basic cooking skills, cooking in college means you can save money, eat healthier, and have greater control over the things you eat.

I typically eat oatmeal or granola for breakfast and purchase lunch when I'm on campus, but make dinner at home. In my case, I cook dinner for my three roommates and myself, and, in return, they do all the cleaning.

Since I have a limited amount of time to cook and clean every night, the meals I prepare need to be quick and simple but also nutritious and filling. After cooking almost every day for two semesters, I find myself following the same general meal composition, and using the same hands-off cooking techniques.

#### Hands-Off Cooking
Most of the meals that I cook take between 30 minutes and an hour from start to finish. When possible, I engage in as much hands-off cooking as possible. This means using appliances that do not need to be constantly monitored, such as ovens or rice-cookers. While they run, I can perform other cooking or prep tasks.

#### Meal Composition
Every meal that I prepare consists of a carb, a protein, and some vegetables. 

My go-to carbs are rice and noodles because they are filling and relatively simple to prepare. If you turn on your rice cooker when you start cooking, it will be done cooking by the time you're finished. Noodles are a bit more involved but take much less time; plus you can save even more time by using a kettle to boil water and then adding that to a pot on the stove.

Most of the variety in my diet comes from different types of vegetables. I like to pick out a bunch from the grocery store and roast one in the oven each night. Some of my favorites include butternut squash, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, and brussel sprouts. And, just like the rice cooker, roasting vegetables in the oven is as simple as prepping, seasoning, and waiting. Just be sure to preheat your oven beforehand. 

For protein, I like chicken thigh because it's affordable and flavorful. I usually marinate several meals-worth in advance and then pan-fry them the day-of while the oven and rice cooker are going. When chicken thigh is unavailable, eggs are a great substitute. By the time I finish with the protein, usually the rice and vegetables are also done cooking and dinner can be served.

That's what my average dinner looks like. Some days we'll also make a single large pot of something like chili, curry, or pasta just to switch things up. In the future, I plan on sharing a few of the recipes that have become commonplace in my household. Stay tuned!
