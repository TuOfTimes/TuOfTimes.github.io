Back in January I told myself that I would be writing weekly blog posts to practice rhetoric and share my interests. In the time since then, I wrote a grand total of two posts (which I have since removed). I had difficulty keeping up with the schedule, mostly because I had trouble coming up with things to say. Forcing myself to write for the sake of writing caused me to sacrifice the quality of what I had to say, which very quickly resulted in me not wanting to write at all.

I still believe that writing these blog posts will be a good use of my time, both for practicing my writing and reflecting on my experiences. Thus, I will continue to write, but I will be spending more time on each piece and focusing on topics that I am more interested in. In the future you can expect posts about the time that I spent in Saskatoon, Banff, and Richmond, as well as posts about Singapore that I had originally planned to post back in the January. Here's to more quality content and writing!
