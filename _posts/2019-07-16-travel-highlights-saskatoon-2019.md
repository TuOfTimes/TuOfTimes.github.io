Earlier this summer I spent four weeks in Saskatoon, SK, studying French with the [Explore](https://www.myexplore.ca/en/) program. I was initially skeptical about the city because I associated its location in central Canada with being isolated and boring. When I arrived in Saskatoon, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find it was extremely diverse and beautiful. Here are some of my favorite pictures from my time there:

On my first day in the city I made a trip to [Homestead Ice Cream](http://homesteadicecream.ca/). The shop makes all of their ice cream in-house, and is home to many unique flavors. I ordered a Peach Ginger cone, which was reasonably priced and quite good but a bit too sweet for my liking.

In the second week, we took a class trip to [Wanuskewin Heritage Park](https://wanuskewin.com/), which is about 20 minutes north of Saskatoon by car. The park pays homage to the First Nations people and we participated in several activities including building a teepee, shooting a bow-and-arrow, and exploring the nearby countryside.

We were free to explore the city on weekends. One of my favorite destinations was the Saskatchewan River, which runs right through the middle of Saskatoon. Along the river you can find paths, walkways and beautiful parks.

This is my favorite picture from the entire trip. The long summer days in Saskatoon culminate in beautiful sunsets, which I found to be best enjoyed while walking the trails near the University of Saskatchewan and Saskatchewan River.

My first, last, and only sunrise in Saskatoon. I took this picture at 5 am as I was getting ready to leave for Richmond, VA. Thinking back, Saskatoon is a relatively unknown city that I would have never thought to visit. But after seeing it for myself, I would recommend it to everyon.
