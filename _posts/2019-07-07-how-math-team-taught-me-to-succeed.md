I was first introduced to "competitive" math in fourth grade. At the time, I was makings short work of every math worksheet thrown at me, so my teacher resorted to handing out math olympiad problems to keep me entertained. Those worksheets fueled my mathematical curiosity, and later inspired me to join the middle school math team.

Thereafter, I met with my fellow mathletes twice a week to solve problems and discuss solutions in preparation for monthly "math meets". I developed a broad repertoire of problem-solving techniques and learned to apply them quickly and correctly while under immense time pressure.

More importantly, I learned how to tackle on seemingly insolvable problems. More than once I found myself sitting at a desk, a 10-minute timer slowly counting down in the background, with no idea how to approach a question. In these moments, I would step back and reasses the problem, knowing that some new angle of attack may yield the solution.

Failure was common. My tactic may have only helped me 10% of the time, but that never stopped me from trying. The fact that I had chance to turn things around was all the motivation I needed. Each defeat was followed by a thorough review of the problem, so that it wouldn't stump me gain.

Now, three years after my last math meet, I still carry that attitude into each and every challenge that I face. The stakes may be greater, and the lessons harder, but the method still remains the same. By teaching me how to fail, math team taught me how to succeed.
