Hello! My name is **E**dward **T**u.

I am rising senior at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, pursuing a BSc in Honours Computer Science and Biology. Currently I am working as a Software Engineering Intern in Richmond, VA, as a part of Capital One's Technology Development Program. I am well-versed in many technologies, but I place greater value on the impact of my projects.

This website is built using pure HTML and CSS on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is a means for me to practice writing and self reflection while exploring minimal and responsive website design. You can expect most of the posts to be about my travel and work experiences, but I will try and write about whatever comes to mind.
