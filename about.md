Hello! My name is Edward Tu.

I am currently a student at McGill University in Montreal studying Computer Science and Biology, and I plan on becoming a Software Engineer after I graduate.

This website is meant to be a means for me to explore my interests, practice my writing, and play around with simple web development tools. I will mostly be writing about food, ultimate frisbee, travel, and other miscellaneous topics that may come into my mind.
